# Design by Numbers

An online programming system inspired by the original [DBN project](https://dbn.media.mit.edu/) by the Aesthetics and Computation Group at the MIT Media Laboratory. 

Important facts about syntax and semantics of the original language came from the page [DBN Vocabulary](https://dbn.media.mit.edu/info/vocabulary.html) by Zach Lieberman and Rusty Soo-Tho.
